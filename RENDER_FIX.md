# 🔧 Render.com Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
The deployment was failing because Render couldn't find the package.json file in the correct location.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Root package.json Created**
- Added a root-level `package.json` that handles the frontend subdirectory
- Contains scripts that navigate to the frontend folder and run commands
- Specifies Node.js version requirements

### **2. Updated render.yaml**
- Simplified build and start commands
- Uses root-level package.json scripts
- Proper static file publishing path

### **3. Deployment Commands**
Now Render will run:
- **Build**: `npm run build` (which runs `cd frontend && npm install && npm run optimize-images && npm run build`)
- **Start**: `npm run start` (which runs `cd frontend && npm run start`)

## 🚀 Re-deploy Steps

1. **Commit the fixes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render.com deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - Or it should auto-deploy if you have auto-deploy enabled

## 📋 Alternative Manual Configuration

If the render.yaml doesn't work, manually configure in Render dashboard:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start`
- **Publish Directory**: `frontend/dist`
- **Node Version**: 18.17.0

## 🔍 What This Fixes

- ✅ Correct package.json location
- ✅ Proper directory navigation
- ✅ Frontend dependency installation
- ✅ Image optimization during build
- ✅ Static file serving

The deployment should now work correctly! 🎉
